# Deprecated cauldron.io feedback repo

This used to be the repo for gathering feedback about [The Cauldron](https://cauldron.io), and refers to an ancient version of it.

The current version of The Cauldron is being developed in the [cauldronio GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio), where you can find most of the documentation, including how to provide feedback. In particular, there is the [cauldron repo](https://gitlab.com/cauldronio/cauldron), where you can submit an issue with your feedback, and the [Cauldron Community Site](https://community.cauldron.io/) where you can find documentation, news, and interact with the Cauldron community.

## Old information about cauldron.io

[The cauldron.io site described here was substituted by a new from-scratch implementation in early 2020]
